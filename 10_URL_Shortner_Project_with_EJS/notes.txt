EJS is used to make server side rendering more easy
In this Project we will be using the views folder that will be used for server side rendering

Ejs files are just normal html files that are made in views folder

This views folder makes our code more clean by separating the html code that needs to be rendered





In home.ejs file we can access the values passed like this
 <!-- The urls is coming from the index.js file where we are passing these values -->
 <% urls.forEach(url => { %>
    <li><%= url.shortId %></li>
 <% }) %>
