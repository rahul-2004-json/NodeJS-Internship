Model View Controller

Controller manipulates the model and model updates the view
This structure is usefull when we have lots of schema and models to be handled and those cannot be written only in single file as it may make code crowded
This will allow use to keep the different sections of code in separate files


Note the Sequence of Execution in MVC model is 
user calls -> route calls -> Controllers then manipulates the model
