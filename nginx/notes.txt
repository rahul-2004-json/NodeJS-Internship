Forward Proxy : Multiple clients access the server through VPN server
-In forward proxy server is unknown to which user it is connected to.
Reverse Proxy : It is opposite of forward proxy , single client access multiple server through VPN server.
-In reverse proxy client is unknown to which server it is going to be connected.

-The intermediate VPN here is usually NGINX
-In real world development we usually do not interact directly with the server but Nginx is used as intermediator.


Google also uses reverse proxy 
-When we access the www.google.com/maps this is handled by different server allocated for handeling this particular server
-When we access the www.google.com/youtube it will be reverse proxy to a different server.

------------GRAPHQL---------
GraphQL
How is GraphQL different from RESTAPI

-In RestAPI we need to visit different routes or endpoints in order 
to reach to our data and get what we want , with that data we also get the things that are not necessarly needed.

-GraphQL comes into picture at this moment where it works on 
the basis of query. Here we query what we actually want and get the exact data nothing less nothing more.
