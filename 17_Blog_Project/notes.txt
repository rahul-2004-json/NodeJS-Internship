In package.json we have some dependencies like this
"devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.4"
}
These are dev dependencies that will not be uploaded during the time of production and is used only at development phase


"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",   //This is start script for production level that will run only once
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"   //This is start script for development level
}

For password hashing we will be using salt and pepper approach
