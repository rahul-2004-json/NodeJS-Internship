Authentications 

Authentications Patterns are of two types
Statefull              Stateless


Statefull : Which maintains state or data or server side 
Stateless : Which does not have any state



Statefull : can be understood by example of a Valet parking and the ticket it gives to us that maps our car with that ticket and valet writes the unique number in its record.

//How statefull example works between client and server
1.client requests to login with username and password to server
2.Server then provides us session uid just like parking boy gave us ticket / server keeps track of this id associated to our name
3.Now next time whenever client tries to access the endpoints , session id will get associated with it and server will authenticate permissions based on that and return the response.
4.How uids can be transfered to the client
 - cookies  // used more in browser
 - response
 - headers  //used more in rest api


//For Authentications purpose separate routes will be created in routes folder


//Main flaw in this code is that wheneverwe refresh or restart the server the uid gets erased
