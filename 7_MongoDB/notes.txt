MongoDB works on BSON file format BSON(Binary Javascript Object Notation)
Best for Node Applications

As in sql we have tables
In MongoDB we have collections



//Some MongoDB Commands
show dbs
use<db_name>
show collections
db.coll.find()
db.coll.insert()



//How Mongoose works
In Mongoose we create a Schema - This basically defines a structure 
    we use this schema to make model 
    Using this model we do CRUD Operations
