/*
RestFULL API:
Basic Rule of RESTfull api is that Both Server and Client should be independent and 
1.they should follow server-client architecture
-Client requests to server
-server responds to client

2.But server can send anything like html,image,text,json but according to Restfull api this should not happen
Hence we should be sending the json file format , which makes both server and client as independent 
and allows client to take information from json and render accordingly

3.We should respect all the HTTP Methods , meaning we should perform task from them for which they are designed like get,post,put,patch,delete.
